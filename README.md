# InfinitePractice

A React-based web app that uses AI (GPT-4o) to generate adaptive practice questions (MCQs, short answer, fill-in-the-blank) from uploaded class notes.

## Features
- Paste or upload notes, select question type, and number of questions.
- Uses OpenAI API (user-provided key) for live question generation.

## How to Run

I simply copy/pasted the code to codesandbox.io to run it myself, but I am not familiar with the CS/Software Engineering Skills needed for best practices or to share it.
